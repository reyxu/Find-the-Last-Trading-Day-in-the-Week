# Find-the-Last-Trading-Day-of-the-Week

In option resesarch, sometimes we need to find the last trading day of the week. Most weeks the day would be a Friday. But occasionally due to national holidays or other reasons, it could be a Thursday, or even a Monday. 

In this exercise, I will find the last trading day of the week in four steps. 

Alternatively with a little change, it could be used to find the last quoted date of the week with given quote dates, or of the month, etc.
